# Project: VPS Health Dashboard (Python) - Week 1

This project is a command-line tool to monitor and save system health metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk) from a VPS.

## âœ… Phase 1: Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up a modern Python project with `uv`.
- [x] Created and activated a virtual environment.
- [x] Installed external dependencies (`psutil`).
- [x] Fetched core system metrics:
  - [x] CPU Usage
  - [x] RAM Usage
  - [x] Disk Usage
- [x] Refactored the script into a clean structure using functions (`main`, `get_cpu_usage`, etc.).
- [x] Organized collected metrics into a Python dictionary.
- [x] Implemented file I/O to save the metrics to a timestamped JSON file.

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Next Steps

- [ ] **Begin the Go rewrite:** Reimplement this exact tool in Go to compare the languages.
- [ ] **Git Version Control:** Commit the finished Python project to a Git repository with clear commit messages.
- [ ] **Write Comparison Document:** After finishing the Go version, write a brief document comparing the experience of building the tool in Python vs. Go.
