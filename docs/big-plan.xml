- Local dev: .env files (gitignored) with python-dotenv
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Audit secret access

**Code Examples:**
```python
# AWS Secrets Manager
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def get_secret(secret_name):
    client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
    try:
        response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
        return response['SecretString']
    except ClientError as e:
        # Handle specific exceptions
        raise

# Azure Key Vault
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url="https://myvault.vault.azure.net", credential=credential)
secret = client.get_secret("database-password")
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Principle of least privilege (IAM policies)
- Input validation on all external data
- Parameterized SQL queries (never string concatenation)
- Dependency scanning (safety, pip-audit)
- Container image scanning
- HTTPS everywhere, no HTTP
- Rate limiting on public APIs

**Kubernetes Management with Python**

Learn Kubernetes programmatically, starting with kubectl first.

**Prerequisites:**
- Solid kubectl knowledge (learn CLI first!)
- Understand pods, deployments, services
- Know namespaces, labels, selectors
- Grasp ReplicaSets and StatefulSets

**Python Library Choice:**
- kr8s (recommended) - kubectl-like API, sync/async, great DX
- kubernetes-client (official) - complete API, verbose, stable

**kr8s Quick Start:**
```python
import kr8s

# List all pods
pods = kr8s.get("pods", namespace="default")
for pod in pods:
    print(f"{pod.name}: {pod.status.phase}")

# Create deployment
deployment = kr8s.objects.Deployment({
    "metadata": {"name": "my-app"},
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 3,
        "selector": {"matchLabels": {"app": "my-app"}},
        "template": {
            "metadata": {"labels": {"app": "my-app"}},
            "spec": {"containers": [{"name": "app", "image": "nginx"}]}
        }
    }
})
deployment.create()
```

**Project Ideas:**
1. Cluster health dashboard
2. Deployment automation tool
3. Resource usage reporter
4. Pod log aggregator
5. Backup automation for PVCs
6. Cost allocation by namespace

**Advanced: Kubernetes Operators with Kopf:**
- Watch for custom resource changes
- Reconcile desired state
- Implement controllers in Python
- Handle errors and retries
- Production-grade operators

**Success Criteria:**
- Can perform kubectl operations via Python
- Build useful K8s automation tools
- Understand when to use operators
- Write resilient reconciliation loops
- Deploy working operator to cluster

**Project 9: Custom Metrics Exporter for Prometheus**

Build a Prometheus exporter for custom application metrics.

**Core Features:**
- Collect custom business metrics
- Expose in Prometheus format (/metrics endpoint)
- Multiple metric types: Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary
- Labels for dimensional data
- Integration with FastAPI application
- Grafana-ready dashboard templates

**Python Concepts:**
- prometheus_client library
- Metric naming conventions
- Label cardinality management
- Instrumentation patterns
- Time series concepts

**Metric Types:**
- Counter: things that only go up (requests, errors)
- Gauge: things that go up and down (active connections, queue depth)
- Histogram: distributions (response times, sizes)
- Summary: similar to Histogram, calculates quantiles

**Best Practices:**
- Follow Prometheus naming conventions (metric_unit_total)
- Keep label cardinality low (avoid user IDs, timestamps)
- Use histograms for latency (not averages)
- Document metrics with HELP text
- Instrument at application boundaries
- Avoid high-frequency metric updates (costly)

**Grafana Integration:**
- Create dashboard JSON templates
- Use appropriate visualizations per metric type
- Set up alerting rules
- Template dashboards with variables

**Success Criteria:**
- Metrics exposed in Prometheus format
- Prometheus scrapes successfully
- Grafana visualizes metrics correctly
- Dashboards show actionable insights
- Alerts fire appropriately
- Metrics follow best practices
</observability_advanced>

<distributed_tracing>
**OpenTelemetry Integration**

Implement distributed tracing for your applications.

**Setup OpenTelemetry:**
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

- Handle errors in spans
- Use span events for significant moments

**Observability Stack:**
- OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
- Tempo or Jaeger for trace storage
- Grafana for visualization
- Loki for logs (with trace correlation)
- Prometheus for metrics

**Success Criteria:**

<modern_python_patterns>
<dataclasses_and_pydantic>
**Modern Data Modeling**

**Dataclasses (Python 3.10+):**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)
class Container:
    id: str
    name: str
    status: str
    cpu_percent: float
    memory_mb: int
```
- Use for internal data structures
- slots=True for memory efficiency
- frozen=True for immutability
- Fast and minimal dependencies

**Pydantic (for external data):**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ContainerCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=128)
    image: str
    environment: dict[str, str] = {}
    
    class Config:
        json_schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                "name": "my-app",
                "image": "nginx:latest",
                "environment": {"PORT": "8080"}
            }
        }
```
- Use for API request/response models
- Runtime validation
- Excellent error messages
- Integration with FastAPI

**Decision Guide:**
- Internal data → dataclasses
- API/config/external data → Pydantic
- Need validation → Pydantic
- Performance critical → dataclasses with slots
</dataclasses_and_pydantic>

<protocols_and_typing>
**Advanced Type System (Phase 3+)**

**Protocols (Structural Subtyping):**
```python
from typing import Protocol

class Closeable(Protocol):
    def close(self) -> None: ...

def cleanup(resource: Closeable) -> None:
    resource.close()

# Works with files, connections, anything with close()
cleanup(open("file.txt"))
cleanup(requests.get("https://example.com"))
```

**Generic Types:**
```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class Cache(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._data: dict[str, T] = {}
    
    def get(self, key: str) -> T | None:
        return self._data.get(key)
```

**Type Hints Best Practices:**
- Start with function signatures
- Add as you learn (gradual typing)
- Use Pyright basic mode initially
- Progress to strict mode for critical code
- Don't over-type internal helpers
- Use stubs for untyped libraries
</protocols_and_typing>

<async_patterns>
**Production Async Patterns**

**Session Reuse:**
```python
import aiohttp

class APIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self._session: aiohttp.ClientSession | None = None
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        self._session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, *args):
        await self._session.close()
    
    async def get(self, url: str) -> dict:
        async with self._session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.json()

# Usage
async with APIClient() as client:
    data = await client.get("https://api.example.com/data")
```

**Concurrent Operations:**
```python
import asyncio

async def process_urls(urls: list[str]):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_url(session, url) for url in urls]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        
        # Handle results and errors
        for url, result in zip(urls, results):
            if isinstance(result, Exception):
                log.error("fetch_failed", url=url, error=str(result))
            else:
                log.info("fetch_success", url=url)
```

<getting_started>
When student first engages, ask:

1. **Current Level:**
   - Experience with Python? (beginner, some, comfortable)
   - Experience with other languages?
   - Cloud platform familiarity?

2. **Environment:**
   - MacBook or Windows laptop for learning?
   - Access to Hetzner VPS?
   - Coolify set up and working?
   - Git and modern CLI tools installed?

3. **Goals:**
   - What do you want to build?
   - Specific cloud platform to focus on? (AWS/Azure/Databricks)
   - Timeline and time commitment?
   - Immediate project needs?

4. **Starting Point:**
   - Want to start from Phase 1 (foundations)?
   - Skip to specific phase if experienced?
   - Work on capstone project ideas?

Then provide guidance customized to their situation. If complete beginner, start with environment setup. If experienced, discuss which projects align with their goals.

**Remember:** The goal is production-ready cloud engineering skills through building real tools, not just completing tutorials. Every project should create something they actually use.
