# .claude/ Folder Reorganization

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Purpose:** Align AI assistant configuration with learning phase progression

---

## Why the Change?

The previous `.claude/` setup was designed for **Phase 4** complexity (advanced cloud engineering with large codebases), but you're starting in **Phase 1** (Python fundamentals). This mismatch created:

### Previous Setup Issues
- **4 specialized workflow agents** (investigator â†’ code-flow-mapper â†’ planner) meant for complex multi-file analysis
- **Python hooks requiring debugging skills** you're still building
- **63+ permission rules** covering technologies irrelevant to Python learning (PHP, GitLab, DevExtreme, Puppeteer)
- **Orchestrated commands** assuming advanced workflow automation needs

**Analogy:** It was like giving a learner driver a Formula 1 race car with a 200-page manual.

---

## The Two-Stage Approach

Instead of one setup for all phases, we're using a **progressive disclosure strategy**:

### Stage 1: NOW (Phases 1-3 Support)
Current structure supports Projects 0-8 with phase-appropriate tools. Complex Phase 4 orchestration is archived for later.

### Stage 2: LATER (One Update at Phase 3â†’4 Transition)
When starting Project 9+, you'll restore 6 files from `archive/phase4/` to enable advanced workflow automation.

**Benefit:** Minimal reorganizations (just this setup + one update later), clear progression path, no overwhelm.

## What Changed?

### âœ… New Structure (Phase 1-3 Ready)

        â””â”€â”€ hooks/               # task_hard_prep_hook workflow automation
```

### ðŸ“¦ Archived for Later

Moved to `.claude/archive/phase4/`:
- **3 workflow agents:** investigator, code-flow-mapper, planner (for large codebase analysis)
- **2 orchestration commands:** task_easy, task_hard (multi-step workflows)
- **1 workflow hook:** task_hard_prep_hook (automatic directory preparation)

Each archived file includes activation notes explaining prerequisites and restoration steps.

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase-Aware Files

Files that stay but are marked for future activation:
- **agents/code-reviewer.md:** Phase 3+ header explains when to enable
- **commands/commit.md:** Phase 2+ activation guidance at top
- **hooks/tool_validator.py:** Phase 3+ prerequisites and educational value explained

---

## Evolution Map

### Phase 1 (Projects 0-3): Fundamentals
**Active:**
- learning-reviewer agent (educational code feedback)

**Available:**
- All files visible for learning, but most are dormant with clear activation criteria

### Phase 2 (Projects 4-6): Cloud & APIs
**Enable After Project 3:**
- commands/commit.md - Structured git commit workflow
- Create your first custom command (e.g., /quick-check for lint+format+test)

### Phase 3 (Projects 7-8): Production Patterns
**Enable After Project 6:**
- agents/code-reviewer.md - Production-focused review (async, security, scalability)
- hooks/tool_validator.py - Enforces modern CLI tools + serves as educational Python example

### Phase 4 (Projects 9+): Advanced Cloud
**Enable After Project 8:**
- Restore 6 files from `archive/phase4/`
- Activate investigator/mapper/planner workflow agents
- Enable task orchestration commands
- Full production automation for complex projects

## Activation Instructions

### For Phase 2 Features (After Project 3)

**1. Enable commit command:**
```bash
# File is already in place, just start using it
/commit
```

**2. Create your first custom command:**
```bash
# Create a new command file based on your repetitive tasks
# See commands/README.md for guidance
```

### For Phase 3 Features (After Project 6)

**1. Enable code-reviewer agent:**
Edit `CLAUDE.md` under "Current Setup":
```markdown
## Active Components
- agents/learning-reviewer.md
- agents/code-reviewer.md  # ADD THIS LINE
```

**2. Enable tool_validator hook:**
Edit `.claude/settings.json`, uncomment the hooks section:
```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "uv run .claude/hooks/tool_validator.py",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Update `CLAUDE.md` to mark as ACTIVE.

### For Phase 4 Features (After Project 8)

**See `archive/phase4/README.md` for detailed restoration instructions.**

**Quick version:**
```bash
# Copy archived agents back
mv .claude/archive/phase4/agents/* .claude/agents/

# Copy archived commands back
mv .claude/archive/phase4/commands/* .claude/commands/

# Copy archived hooks back
mv .claude/archive/phase4/hooks/* .claude/hooks/

# Update settings.json to enable workflow hooks
# Update CLAUDE.md to mark all as ACTIVE
```

## Key Benefits

### âœ… Appropriate Complexity
Phase 1 is simple and transparent. No overwhelming file forest to decode.

### âœ… Clear Progression
Progress tracker in CLAUDE.md shows exactly where you are and what's next.

### âœ… Educational Arc
Dormant files have headers explaining prerequisites and what you'll learn.

### âœ… Minimal Maintenance
Two updates total: this reorganization + Phase 4 restoration.

### âœ… No Lost Work
Everything from the sophisticated previous setup is preserved in `archive/phase4/`.

## Living CLAUDE.md

The most important change: **CLAUDE.md is now in the project root** and serves as your mission control.

**Update it after every project completion:**
1. Change project status (â¬œ â†’ ðŸŽ¯ â†’ âœ…)
2. Update "Last Updated" date
3. Adjust "Focus for Current Project" section
4. Add reflection notes
5. Mark new features as ACTIVE when enabled

This keeps the AI assistant (Claude) synchronized with your actual progress and ensures phase-appropriate guidance.

## Questions?

- **"Can I activate Phase 3 features earlier?"**
  Yes, but the prerequisites are there for good reason. The code-reviewer expects familiarity with async patterns. The tool_validator is educational Python code that's more useful once you've completed Projects 1-3.

- **"What if I want to skip Phase 4 orchestration entirely?"**
  Totally fine! The archived workflow agents are for large, complex projects. If your Phase 4 capstone is smaller or you prefer simpler workflows, just leave them archived.

- **"Can I create my own agents/commands?"**
  Absolutely! See `guide.md` for detailed instructions. Phase 2 is the perfect time to create your first custom command based on repetitive tasks you've discovered.

---

**Remember:** This structure grows with you. Start simple in Phase 1, enable features as you progress, restore advanced tools only when genuinely useful.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
